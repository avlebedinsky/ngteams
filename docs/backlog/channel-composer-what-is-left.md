# A channel's compose box and threads: what Teams has that the app doesn't yet

A team's channel now opens as Teams' threaded channel: its posts as a chat's messages with each post's replies summed
up, "Message in <channel>" posting to the channel, a post's thread beside it whose "Reply in thread" box posts to the
post's chain, and reactions, edits, deletes, copying and workflows as in a chat. What is left, each needing a capture
or a read nobody has made yet:

- **The web client's shapes of the writes.** The native writes ran live from a lab client on a lab team whose only
  person is that lab account: a post (201), a reply posted to the post's chain (201, read back under its post), a
  reaction on each (200) and an edit of the reply (200). The web client's own requests weren't captured: a
  `team-manage` run on such a team should post, reply in a thread and react in the web client, looking for anything it
  adds to a channel post (`subject`, `properties.announceViaEmail`, the chain's `conversationid`) that the chat's
  `SendMessage` leaves out.
- **Files in a channel.** Teams puts a channel's files in its team's SharePoint folder (`sharepointChannelDocsFolder`
  on the channel's thread), not the account's OneDrive, and shares them with the team. The box offers no Attach in a
  channel and the engine refuses a channel message with files until that upload and its permissions are captured.
- **Mentions in a channel.** The box's picker offers a chat's stored members; a channel stores none, so it offers
  nobody. Teams offers the team's people and the channel and the team themselves (`@channel`, `@team`).
- **"Send to: thread and channel".** Teams' thread box can also post the reply to the channel; the app says "Send to:
  thread only" and sends only to the thread until that write is captured.
- **Typing and the read horizon.** A channel's box sends no typing and its view no read receipt (no capture showed a
  channel's); Teams shows typing in a channel and moves the channel's horizon, which the channels' unread marks follow.
- **The classic "Posts" layout.** Some channels still use Teams' Posts layout ("Post in channel", "Reply in thread"
  under each post); the app draws every channel in the threaded layout. Which layout a channel has (CSA's `modality`?)
  isn't read yet.
- **The channel header.** Teams' header has the team's tile, the channel's name and its tabs (Conversation, Shared,
  Page, Notes, +); the app's has the tile and the name, no tabs. The thread pane's header in Teams is
  "Threads › <thread>" with a threads list behind "Threads" and a follow button; the app's says "Thread" with Close.
- **A new reply under an old post.** A post keeps its place, so a reply to a post older than the posts loaded (a page
  of 50) shows nowhere until the posts are scrolled back to it; Teams' threads list (above) and its activity feed are
  where such a reply is seen.
