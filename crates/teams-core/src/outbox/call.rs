//! The outbox's call kind (M3 Task 14): a call's writes (the sealed `teams-proto` call writes the `teams-call` machine
//! builds) go out from here too, each attempt under a fresh [`Fence::check`](teams_fence::Fence::check) with its
//! `fence.log` line and the transport's rules, but neither as a row nor as a transient: nothing of a call write is
//! stored, checked for, offered to send again or sent by a later run, and none waits in the outbox, is replaced by a
//! newer one or dropped by a message post. Its answer, whatever its status, goes back to the machine with its body
//! (the conversation a start opened, an `attach`'s or an `accept`'s answer), and the machine decides what a failed step
//! means (Task 14's decision with Codex).
//!
//! **One attempt at a time, and at most three.** [`Outbox::try_call`] makes one attempt; [`CallRetries`] says whether
//! another may follow, and only for an answer that says the service didn't act: a 401 gets one more attempt at once
//! (the transport renewed the refused skypetoken), a 429 or 503 (or a throttled token service) one more after its
//! `Retry-After` ([`DEFAULT_RETRY_WAIT`] without one) when that is at most [`MAX_TRANSIENT_WAIT`]; once each, never
//! reset. An outcome that isn't known (a network error, a timeout, a 5xx other than 503) is never followed by another
//! attempt: a call controller acting twice is worse than a failed step. The engine asks the machine before each further
//! attempt (`teams_call::Calls::may_send_again`): a call that ended wants nothing more of it but its cleanup.
