//! Local search (M2 Task 15): the core hands the store each message's plain text as it stores it, and indexes the
//! messages stored before the index existed in the background. The query is the store's ([`Store::search`]): the
//! account's own messages, never the service's search (Substrate lists other tenant users, and is never called).
//!
//! - **The text** ([`search_text`]): a rich-text message's sanitized [`RichText`](teams_proto::chat::RichText) read
//!   as the reader sees it (its runs, mentions' names, links' text, images' `alt`, a quote's text), a `Text`
//!   message's content as it came; none for a deleted message or one that isn't text (a thread event, a call's
//!   record, a call's media message: a recording's or a transcript's record, whose ids aren't text). Every message the core stores goes through [`crate::Outbox::receive`], which indexes it in the same
//!   write ([`Store::upsert_message_indexed`]): an edit replaces its text, a delete removes it.
//! - **The backfill** ([`Backfill`]): the stored messages the index doesn't hold at their version, a bounded batch at
//!   a time ([`INDEX_BATCH`]), in the store's fixed order, from the engine's loop between its other work. The store
//!   keeps what is indexed, so a backfill that stopped goes on at the next start where it was.
