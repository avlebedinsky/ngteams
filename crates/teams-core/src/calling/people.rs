//! Someone added to the account's call, as Teams' People pane adds them ("Invite someone", seen
//! 2026-11-06): in a 1:1 call a new group chat of the three is made first (`POST v1/threads`, the outbox's typed
//! [`CreateChat`], no topic), then the conversation's `add` names it and the call becomes a group call in it; in a
//! group call the call's own chat is named at once. The chat's making is one write of its own beside the call's.
//!
//! A transfer the far end asked for is taken by the machine (`teams-call`); the call to the transfer's target is placed
//! here once the transferred call is over and its media gone, as any start is (its media set up first), as the web
//! client calls the target at once (seen 2026-11-06). Nobody but the far end's transfer asks for that call.
