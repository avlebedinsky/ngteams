//! Who is in a call as the account sees it (M3 Task 19): the participants its roster names, whose video each of a
//! group call's receiving lines shows, and who is speaking.
//!
//! - **The participants** are the roster's (`teams_call::Participant`, the account left out), in the order they came.
//! - **Whose video goes where** (a group call's): each receiving line ([`super::GROUP_SLOTS`] of them, numbered from
//!   1 as the media numbers its video lines) shows one participant's video. A participant keeps its line while it is
//!   in the call and its video source stays the same; a free line goes to the next participant without one, those
//!   whose camera is on first. What the lines are to show goes to the mixer as source requests
//!   ([`teams_media::session::SourceRequest`]: the line's stream id, the participant's video source id while its
//!   camera is on, `-1` while it is off), each line only when it changed (the session keeps what went).
//! - **Who is speaking**: in a 1:1 call, the far end while what the speaker plays is louder than [`SPEAKING_LEVEL`];
//!   in a group call, the newest dominant speaker the mixer told (by audio source id) while what the speaker plays is
//!   (the mixer's word alone would keep the last one speaking through a silence), and nobody in a group call without
//!   a control plane (the mixed playout says nothing of who in it speaks). The account itself is speaking while what
//!   its microphone hears is. A level that falls quiet keeps its speaker for [`SPEAKING_HOLD`], so a pause between
//!   words doesn't flicker.
//! - **Whether the microphone hears anything** (before its processing, muted or not; held as speaking is): what the
//!   speaking mark can't tell when the processing takes everything out, as it does an echo it cancels.
