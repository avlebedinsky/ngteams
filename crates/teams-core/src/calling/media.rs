//! A call's media in the engine: set up before the account's start, join or answer goes ([`prepare`]: the relay's
//! credentials read, the session started without its devices (libwebrtc allocating on the relay), our offer or our answer
//! written in Teams' dialect), its devices opened once that start, join or answer was admitted and taken
//! ([`open_devices`]), the far end's SDP applied and renegotiations answered or offered while it runs ([`apply`],
//! [`answer`], [`reoffer`]), the camera turned on or off with the renegotiation it takes ([`camera`]; offered again
//! once a renegotiation of ours gave way to the far end's, [`offer_camera`]), and what the session reports turned into
//! what the call does ([`LiveMedia::poll`]: a camera whose device went away is off).
//!
//! **Video** (M3 Tasks 18, 19): a call's media takes video when the engine has video for its calls ([`CallVideo`]): the
//! session's video starts with it (received frames to the account's sinks by video line, [`VideoOutput`]). A 1:1 call's
//! dialect takes the main video line of what the far end offers, receiving until the camera is on (its camera turned on
//! by a renegotiation). A group call's (placed, joined or answered) takes the main video line, sent on once the camera
//! is on, and up to [`GROUP_SLOTS`] receiving lines, each carrying the participant a source request chose: its offer
//! is the web client's group offer's kind (audio, the main line, the receiving lines, the sharing line, the data
//! channel), its start, join or answer describes those lines (`mediaDescriptions`), and its control plane (the data
//! channel's) is started once the far end's SDP was applied (`teams_media::mcp`). The camera is off when a call starts;
//! only the account's action turns it on. The test call's media is a 1:1 call's (the media controller answers it, its
//! camera turned by a renegotiation); a call whose video can't start carries audio only.
//! **A screen shared, 1:1** (`docs/protocol/calling.md`, "More of a running call"): the account's screen, picked at the
//! desktop's portal ([`pick_screen`]), goes on a sharing line of its own its renegotiation adds ([`share`], stopped by
//! [`stop_share`]); the far end's goes on the sharing line its renegotiation adds, which the dialect answers receiving
//! and whose frames go to the video output's [`teams_media::session::SHARING_LINE`] sink.
//!
//! Every step that blocks (the allocation, opening a device, an SDP command, the session's close) runs on tokio's
//! blocking pool, never on the engine's thread; the session's own threads carry the media.
