//! The organizer's controls of a group call or a meeting, as Teams' People and Controls offer them (seen 2026-11-06,
//! `docs/protocol/calling.md`, "More of a running call"): Mute all ([`CallAction::MuteAll`], the conversation's `mute`
//! through the machine), and the meeting's options read and changed on the middle tier (Controls' Enable lobby and
//! Allow all participants to: [`EngineRequests::call_meeting_options`] reads them, [`CallAction::MeetingOption`]
//! changes one, one attempt, the outbox's retries only). And what binds the account when someone else organizes:
//! Mute all's mute, which the account takes as its own (the microphone silent; nothing told, as the web client tells
//! nothing), and the attendees' restrictions, which the view shows.
