//! Reactions' animations, read when a view asks for one (the picker, under the pointer): Teams' CDN's strip of the
//! reaction's frames ([`ReactionAnimation`], a `GET` with no token), the way the web client reads it.
//!
//! - **Kept for the run**: a strip read is kept in memory and answered from there after; a reaction the CDN has none for
//!   (an answer that isn't a success, or isn't a PNG) is kept as missing. A read that failed on the way isn't kept
//!   and is answered [`EngineError::AnimationUnread`], so the next ask reads again.
//! - **One read per reaction at a time**: asks while its read runs wait for that read.
//! - Nothing is stored and nothing is written.
