//! The message writes, each through the addressed account's [`Core::write`] as the views write: the outbox makes the
//! row, sends it and applies its retries and its unknown-outcome checks as for the window's own writes. Nothing here
//! builds a request.
//!
//! - `send`: plain text, each line a paragraph, made into the message's text as the compose box makes it
//!   ([`compose::message_of`] of [`compose::plain_doc`]), so its sanitizing and its length limit hold. Text that shows
//!   nothing is refused, as the box sends nothing then; a text `teams-proto` refuses (too long, …) is refused with
//!   its reason.
//! - `edit`: one of the account's messages, its text replaced the same way, its quote of another message (a reply's,
//!   a forward's) kept as the box keeps it.
//! - `delete`, `react`, `unreact`: a message by its id, a reaction by its key (`like`, `heart`, …).
//! - `read`: the chat marked read up to its newest message a read receipt can name (someone else's, counted unread,
//!   not deleted), as the chat view sends one; nothing to do (`done`) when the account read that far already. A
//!   channel is refused, as the chat view sends no receipt there (no capture showed a channel's).
//! - `new-chat`: the people by MRI, or by UPN as the service's people search finds them (New message's directory
//!   suggestions); their 1:1 chat for one, a new group chat for more. The row names the chat made once it went out.
//! - `resend`: an outbox row sent again ([`Core::resend`]), as the window's "Send again" does.
//! - `status get`: what the account's own presence reports ([`reporting_name`]) and the status chosen in the
//!   settings. `status set`: chosen as the account menu's status menu chooses it (`Shell::choose_status`), its own
//!   presence told and the choice saved in the settings, which keep it across the app's runs and re-apply it on any
//!   other change of the settings; `reset` is Automatic again. The report goes out through the engine as the menu's
//!   does, and the answer is the status as the choice left it (a report that fails shows as `not-set`).
//! - `sync`: a catch-up now ([`Core::sync`]), answered with what it did, [`SYNC_ANSWER`] at most. A read, so the
//!   read-only mode runs it too.
//!
//! Each answers with its outbox row as its first attempt left it, [`WRITE_ANSWER`] at most (past it, a timeout saying
//! the write may still go out); asked to `wait`, once the row settled (sent, failed, or one that may have arrived,
//! which nothing sends again on its own), [`WRITE_WAIT`] more at most. The read-only mode
//! refuses every write ([`ErrorCode::RefusedReadOnly`]), as its transport would; `status set` too.
