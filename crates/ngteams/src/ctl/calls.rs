//! The call commands, each asked through [`calls::ask_then`] as the call buttons ask: the calls' model decides what it
//! can (one call at a time, an invitation that rings, a call up), the engine checks it again and sends its requests
//! through the outbox. Nothing here builds a request, answers, declines or joins on its own, or turns a camera on: each
//! command is the user's ask.
//!
//! - `calls`: the call up and the invitation that rings, of every account (of the one addressed with `--account`).
//! - `call <chat>`, `join <chat>`: the chat named as the reads name it ([`address::chat`]), called or its running call
//!   joined; `answer`, `decline`: the invitation that rings; `hangup`: the call up left (or its ring cancelled).
//! - `mute on|off|toggle`, `camera on|off|toggle`: the microphone or the camera of the call up, asked only when it
//!   isn't as `on`/`off` says already. They are asked one at a time, each once the one before it was answered: the
//!   call shows a switch as it is only then, so one asked meanwhile would be compared with what it was before.
//!
//! **The account**: the one `--account` names, otherwise the one ringing, in a call or setting one up (calls are one
//! at a time across the accounts), otherwise the one the window shows. A start, a join or an answer while another
//! account is busy is refused ([`ErrorCode::Busy`]), as the shell refuses it.
//!
//! **The answer**: [`ErrorCode::NoCalling`] in an app that shows no calls (its devices couldn't be opened). An ask the
//! calls' model refused, or the engine did, is its error: [`ErrorCode::Busy`], [`ErrorCode::NoCall`],
//! [`ErrorCode::NotRinging`], [`ErrorCode::NoVideo`], or [`ErrorCode::Engine`] with what the call view would say. An
//! unmute a newer mute or unmute overtook while the microphone reopened ([`Answered::Superseded`]) is
//! [`ErrorCode::Engine`] saying so: the newer one decides, and the call view tells nothing of it.
//! Otherwise, once the engine took it and the app shows the call as it moved on (a start's or an answer's call told,
//! a declined or left one gone), the call's row ([`Response::Call`]; one that ended says `ended`). All of it within
//! [`CALL_ANSWER`], past which [`ErrorCode::Timeout`].
