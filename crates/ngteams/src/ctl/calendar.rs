//! The calendar commands, through the addressed account's [`Core`] as the calendar reads, and its meetings joined as
//! the calendar's Join and the pre-join's Join now join them.
//!
//! - `calendar`: the account's events between two local dates, both included (today without them), read from the
//!   service now ([`Core::calendar`]), by their start. A range wider than one read takes
//!   ([`MAX_CALENDAR_WINDOW_MS`]) is read that much at a time, an event across two reads listed once.
//! - `calendar show <id>`: one event, read whole now ([`Core::calendar_event`]).
//! - `join meeting <id>`: the event read whole, then its meeting's pre-join opened in the call window as the
//!   calendar's Join opens it ([`calls::show_prejoin`]); nothing goes out. With `now`, the pre-join's Join now asked
//!   at once ([`calls::join_now_then`]: the microphone on, the camera off, the devices the settings chose), answered
//!   as the call commands answer a join ([`super::calls`]): once the engine took it, the meeting's call as told;
//!   otherwise why it went nowhere (a media setup that failed after the call was told included).
//!
//! **A meeting the app joins** is an event that names its chat and its organizer (its join link's `context`), or only
//! its chat, whose thread then names the organizer ([`Core::meeting`]). Any other event (no Teams meeting, or a short
//! `/meet/` link alone, which the calendar opens in the browser) is [`ErrorCode::NoMeeting`], its link told.
//! **An event's row** says `joinable` for such an event in an app that shows calls and isn't read-only.
//!
//! **The account**: the one `--account` names, otherwise the one the window shows (an event is its account's own).
//! A join while a call is up, rings or is being set up there or on another account is refused ([`ErrorCode::Busy`]),
//! as the calendar's Join refuses it; the read-only mode refuses it ([`ErrorCode::RefusedReadOnly`]); an app that
//! shows no calls answers [`ErrorCode::NoCalling`]. A join answers within [`CALL_ANSWER`], a calendar read within
//! [`CALENDAR_ANSWER`].
