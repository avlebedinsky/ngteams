//! The control socket's server: what `ngteamsctl` talks to (`docs/plans/20261106-ngteamsctl.md`; the protocol is
//! `teams-ctl`'s).
//!
//! It is one more caller of what the window calls: the accounts' `Core`, the desktop and the settings. Nothing in it
//! builds a request, and it opens no store.
//!
//! - [`listener`]: the socket (`0600` in a `0700` directory, a stale one replaced, a live one refused), a thread
//!   accepting connections and a thread per connection reading its lines.
//! - [`dispatch`]: each request answered on GPUI's foreground, over the app's accounts as they run.
//! - [`address`]: the account and the chat a request names.
//! - [`reads`]: the read commands, through the account's `Core`.
//! - [`ui`]: the UI commands (the window, the views it opens, the account it shows) and the actions dispatched to it.
//! - [`writes`]: the message writes, through the account's `Core::write`, its outbox.
//! - [`calls`]: the call commands, asked of the account's calls as the call buttons ask them.
//! - [`events`]: the event stream a `subscribe` turns a connection into, fed by each account's bridge tap,
//! - [`watch`]: by the app's own state where it changes (unread, own status, sign-out, notifications, the window),
//! - and [`ticker`]: by each account's calendar, for the meetings about to start.
//!
//! The requests cross from the connections' threads to the foreground through a channel, where one task takes them in
//! turn and answers each in a task of its own; each answer goes back through a oneshot to the thread that asked (a
//! `subscribe`'s with its stream, which that thread writes from then on). The
//! server serves from the app's launch (`Launch::ctl`) until its quit, which closes every connection and removes the
//! socket file.
