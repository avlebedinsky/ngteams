//! The camera's background effects, as Teams offers them: none, the background blurred, or a picture in its place
//! (one of the app's own, [`STOCK`], or one the user added). Each camera frame is cut into the person and the rest by
//! a person segmentation model ([`segment`]), then the rest is blurred or replaced ([`compose`]), before the frame is
//! shown in the self view and sent.
//!
//! - **The choice** ([`BackgroundChoice`]) is shared: the app sets it (the settings' video effects), and the camera's
//!   thread reads it at each frame, so a change shows on the next frame. Choosing an effect never turns a camera on:
//!   it only changes the frames of a camera something else turned on.
//! - **The model** is Google's `MediaPipe` selfie segmenter (landscape, 256 by 144; Apache-2.0), converted to ONNX
//!   once, at development time (`tools/selfie-segmenter/convert.py`), and built into the app. It runs on a thread of
//!   its own beside the camera's ([`segment`]: the camera's thread never waits for it, and takes its newest mask): on
//!   the GPU where there is one ([`gpu`]: Burn on wgpu, from code generated from the ONNX at build time), else on the
//!   CPU (tract), loaded once per process on the first frame that needs it. Until its first mask, and when it can't
//!   load, there is no person in the frame (everything is the background): an effect the user chose never falls back
//!   to showing what it hides.
//! - **The edge** is soft, as Teams draws it ([`edge`]): the model's coarse mask refined against the frame's own
//!   picture so it hugs the person, then feathered over a few pixels, and smoothed over frames where it only
//!   flickers.
//! - **The pictures** are decoded once (a stock one from the bytes built in, the user's from its file), cropped to the
//!   frame's shape and kept as I420 at the frame's size until the choice or the size changes. One that can't be read
//!   is blurred instead, for the same reason.
