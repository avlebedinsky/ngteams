//! Who is in a call, as its roster updates tell it (`docs/protocol/calling.md`, "The roster"): each `rosterUpdate`
//! delivered at the conversation's callback lists the participants that changed, each with a version that counts up;
//! the call's participants are the ones whose latest entry is active and in the call, in the order they were first
//! seen. The account's own entry is left out. A meeting's roster also lists who waits in its lobby (an endpoint with a
//! `lobby` rather than a `call`): told apart, the account's own wait too. Nothing is sent for it: the roster is read only to show who is in the
//! call, whose video goes where, and who speaks (independent of call admission).
