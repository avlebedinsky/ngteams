//! A team channel (M2 Task 16), as Teams' channel shows it: its posts in a [`ChatView`] of the channel
//! ([`Place::Channel`]: a post's replies summed up under it, its compose box "Message in <channel>" posting to the
//! channel), and once a post's "Reply in thread" or its replies' summary is clicked, the post's thread in a pane beside
//! them, a [`ChatView`] of the thread ([`Place::Thread`]: the post and its replies, its box "Reply in thread" posting to
//! the post's chain) under Teams' pane header (its title, and Close). Reactions, edits, deletes, copying and workflows
//! are the chat view's own, in both.
//!
//! - **Synced each time it is opened** ([`ChannelView::sync`], [`Core::sync_conversation`]): a channel other than a
//!   team's general one is in no conversation list, so no catch-up reads it, and a sync that failed is tried again
//!   only so. What it stores comes as the models' change, which the views read again on.
//! - **Opened at a message** ([`ChannelView::reveal`], a search's hit): the posts at the message's thread's post, and
//!   a reply's thread opened at it.
//! - **Drafts are kept** as a chat's are: a thread's box holding text, a reply or an upload is kept when its thread is
//!   closed or another opens, and given back when that thread opens again; the shell keeps the channel's and its
//!   threads' boxes ([`ChannelView::drafts`]) while another channel is shown and hands them back to its next view.
//! - **What it tells** ([`ChannelViewEvent`]): a forward's original, a meeting card's Edit, and a workflow run or made
//!   on a message, for the shell to carry out.
//!
//! What the views show is traced as theirs (`channel-view shown`, `thread-view shown`), and a thread's opening and
//! closing (`channel-thread opened`/`closed`, its post's id), never text or a name.
