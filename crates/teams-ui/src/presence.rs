//! Others' presence as the views show it (M2 Task 17): a dot beside a person in the chat list (a 1:1 chat's other
//! member, on the avatar), the chat's header (its other member) and the mention picker (each member offered).
//!
//! - **From the engine only.** A view asks the engine about everyone it shows ([`watch`]: `Core::presence`, which makes
//!   the engine read them from then on), and draws what the [`Presences`] model holds: the engine's
//!   `Event::Presence`s as the bridge applied them. A person no event told about yet is
//!   [`Availability::Unknown`](teams_core::Availability::Unknown).
//! - **Within the engine's watch** ([`teams_core::MAX_WATCHED`] people, the one asked about longest ago dropped and
//!   told unknown): a view asks again each time it shows its people anew, and the views together ask about no more
//!   than it holds: the chat list its top [`LIST_WATCHED`](crate::chat_list::LIST_WATCHED) 1:1 chats' other members,
//!   the header its chat's, the mention picker the [`PICKER_MAX`](crate::compose::PICKER_MAX) people it offers.
//! - **Unknown** is drawn as a hollow ring: before the first read, for someone this build can't read (in the lab,
//!   anyone but the lab accounts), when a read failed, and for someone no longer watched. A word UPS gave that this build doesn't name is drawn the
//!   same way, its word as the dot's label.
