//! The call's own window ([`CallWindows`]), as Teams opens one for a call: the main window's chats stay usable while it
//! runs. One window at most, whichever account the call is (one call at a time across the accounts: the call floor).
//!
//! - **It opens** once a call of any account is told (a start, a join, the answer of an invitation; not a decline),
//!   brought to the front, the keyboard on it; what it shows is [`CallStage`]'s.
//! - **It closes** once its call ended by the user's own hang-up (or decline). A call that ended any other way (the
//!   far end hung up, it dropped or never connected) keeps its window on how it ended ([`CallStage`]: who it was
//!   with, why it ended in plain words, how long it lasted, Call back or Rejoin, Close) until it is closed, by Close,
//!   the window's own close or by itself a few seconds later; a test call's window stays on its results until it is
//!   closed, as Teams' test call does. A new call takes the window of the last call's end.
//! - **Closing it while the call is up leaves the call** (one hang-up, as the window's Leave asks), as closing Teams'
//!   call window does, without asking. It isn't opened again for that call by itself; the main window's "Return to
//!   call" ([`raise`]) brings it back while the call is still up (its leave refused, say), and else brings the open
//!   window to the front.
//! - **The lab app** opens it on the same display as its main window: inside the UI sandbox, where its main window is.
//!
//! What it does is traced on its account's trace: `call-window opened` (the call's number and kind), `call-window
//! raised`, `call-window closed` (the call's number, and `left` when its closing left the call).
