//! A chat's people, as browser Teams shows them from its header (seen 2026-11-10 with lab accounts): the header's
//! "View and add participants" button opens a flyout listing the chat's people, and from it people are added.
//!
//! - **The flyout**: "People" over a 1:1 chat's two, "People (<n>)" over a group chat's; each with their picture or
//!   initials, their presence on its corner and the account's own marked "You" under its name. Under a rule, a 1:1
//!   chat offers "Start a group chat", a group chat (and a new group chat not made yet) "Add people". The read-only
//!   mode offers neither: it writes nothing.
//! - **The picker** ("Start a group chat", or "Add" for a group chat): "Enter a name, email, or tag" finds the people
//!   the account has a 1:1 chat with and the people the directory finds (the service's suggestions, a moment after
//!   the typing stops), then the group chats whose names hold what was typed; none while nothing is typed. Up and
//!   Down move in them, Enter takes the one highlighted (else the first), Backspace in the empty box takes the last
//!   chip off. Each one taken is a chip with its face and a remove button; a group chat taken stands for its people.
//!   Nobody already in the chat, nor the account, is offered. Cancel closes it; Create or Add is lit once someone is
//!   taken.
//! - **A group chat's history** (its "Add" only): "Don't include chat history" (Teams' default), "Include history
//!   from the past number of days:" with its number (1 to start; digits only, and Add is off while it is empty or
//!   0), or "Include all chat history" ([`ChatHistory`]).
//! - **What a confirm does**: a 1:1 chat's Create hands the shell the people, the partner last
//!   ([`ChatPeopleEvent::StartGroup`]: the unnamed group chat of exactly them opens if there is one, else a new group
//!   chat that its first message makes, as Teams does; the 1:1 chat stays as it was). A group chat's Add goes out
//!   through the outbox ([`Action::AddMembers`]), "Adding..." until the outbox settles it; then the picker closes, or
//!   says what went wrong and keeps the people. A new group chat not made yet takes them into its people
//!   ([`ChatPeopleEvent::AddToDraft`]).
//!
//! Escape or a press outside closes the picker, then the flyout. Traced: `chat-people opened`, `picked` (a count),
//! `added` (the chat), never a name.
