//! A meeting recap's AI summary, made on this computer by the AI command-line tool the user has
//! ([`crate::local_ai`]: Claude Code with Claude Sonnet, or the Codex CLI with GPT-6.1-Terra), laid out as Fathom's
//! call summaries are:
//!
//! - **Meeting purpose**: one line on why the meeting was held;
//! - **Key takeaways**: the few outcomes, decisions and facts that matter most;
//! - **Topics**: what was discussed, in order, each a title with its points, every point at its moment in the
//!   recording (a click plays it from there);
//! - **Next steps**: what someone took on, by its owner, at the moment it was said;
//! - **Questions raised** that were left open, when there were some.
//!
//! - **On demand, and private by default**: nothing goes to a tool until the user asks for a summary. The transcript
//!   (with the meeting's title, its day and who spoke) then goes to that tool and its provider, which the recap says
//!   where it offers the summary. No transcript or summary text is logged or traced.
//! - **What goes to the tool** ([`Input`]): the transcript's paragraphs, each as `[m:ss] Speaker: words`, the time
//!   into the recording. A transcript up to [`run::Limits::single`] characters (about four hours of talk) goes in one
//!   pass; a longer one is split at paragraphs into sections of [`run::Limits::section`] characters, each condensed to
//!   timestamped notes by a run of its own, and the summary is written from the notes ([`run`]).
//! - **The answer** is a JSON object read leniently ([`parse`]): its sections trimmed and capped, its times kept only
//!   when they fall within the recording; one that isn't the object asked for is asked for again once.
//! - **Kept per recording** ([`SummaryCache`]): in memory for the run and as a file beside the settings
//!   ([`SUMMARY_DIR`], named by a hash of the recording's link), so the recap shows it again without asking the tool;
//!   Regenerate makes a new one. A summary runs apart from the view ([`RecapSummary`]): leaving the recap doesn't stop
//!   it.
//! - **Shared**: copied as Markdown ([`plain`]), or sent to the meeting's chat as a rich-text message
//!   ([`chat_message`]) after the user saw it and confirmed.
