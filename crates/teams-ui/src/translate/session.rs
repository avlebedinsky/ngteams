//! One translating tool's process, kept running for the call: started once (so the first caption doesn't wait for a
//! cold start), fed one caption at a time on its stdin and read back from its stdout, on a thread of its own so the
//! window never waits on it.
//!
//! The process is [`crate::local_ai`]'s [`Tool`], with the model picked for captions ([`Work::Captions`]): Claude Code
//! or the Codex CLI, without tools, hooks, MCP servers or saved sessions.
//!
//! **The call's context**: the process keeps the conversation, so each caption is read against the whole call so far
//! (the call's title and people, every caption with its speaker, what was said that wasn't sent, the translations it
//! gave) without that being sent again. The conversation is bounded: after [`Limits::turns`] captions or
//! [`Limits::chars`] characters sent, the tool is asked for the call's glossary (its names, terms and abbreviations
//! with the renderings it used), and a new process starts with the call's brief, that glossary and the recent
//! captions with their translations ([`Memory`]), so a long call stays consistent and each prompt stays small.
//!
//! **Failures** end the session ([`Failure`]): the tool missing, signed out, too slow, or stopped; the model shows the
//! captions as spoken and says why. Nothing here logs a caption, a translation or the tool's output.
