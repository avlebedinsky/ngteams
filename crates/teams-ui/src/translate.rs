//! Live captions translated on this computer, by the AI command-line tool the user has: Claude Code or the Codex CLI,
//! with the model the user picked (by default the fastest: Claude Haiku, GPT-6-Luna). Teams' own caption translation
//! needs a licence; this one needs only the tool.
//!
//! - **Opt-in**: nothing is translated, and no tool starts, until the user picks a language in the captions' settings
//!   ("Translate to", [`crate::settings::Settings::caption_translate_to`]); the Calls settings pick the tool and its
//!   model ([`AiChoice`]: automatically Claude Code when it is installed, else Codex). The captions' text then goes
//!   to that tool, which sends it to its provider; the pane names the tool and model.
//! - **As Teams shows translated captions**: the translation alone, in the speaker's line; until a line's translation
//!   comes, its text as spoken, dimmed. When translating fails (the tool missing, signed out, too slow, stopped), the
//!   captions show as spoken under a notice saying why, with Try again.
//! - **Fast and bounded**: one tool process per call window, kept running ([`session`]), one caption at a time,
//!   finals first, interim text debounced, answers cached ([`schedule`]); everything runs off the window's thread.
//! - **The whole call as context**: the process's conversation holds the call's title and people and every caption
//!   with its speaker; a long call's conversation is renewed with a glossary and the recent captions
//!   ([`session`]'s docs).
//! - **Private**: captions and translations stay in memory, are cleared with the captions, and are never logged or
//!   traced.
