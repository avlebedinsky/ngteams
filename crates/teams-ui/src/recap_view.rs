//! A meeting chat's Recap tab, as Teams draws it (`crate::recap` works out what it shows):
//!
//! - **The top row**: the meeting's line (its day and span) in a box with its menu, "Part 1", "Part 2" when the
//!   meeting was recorded more than once, then Share (its menu: Copy link, the recap's Teams link), Watch in browser
//!   (the recording in Stream, for a part with a recording) and "More options" (Download, for a recording the account
//!   may download, then Open in Teams on the web, Copy link, Refresh).
//! - **Download** saves the shown part's recording where the user chooses (the downloads folder without a chooser),
//!   named as its item names it: offered only when its item says the account may download it (Teams' Stream page,
//!   which Watch in browser opens, offers its Download only then; an attendee whose download the meeting's policy
//!   blocks is offered none). It runs apart from the view ([`crate::recording_download`]): a row under the top row
//!   shows how far it got with Cancel, then Show in folder, or what failed with Try again.
//! - **A recorded part**: the recording played here ([`VideoPlayer`], filling its column at 16:9); beside it the files
//!   shared in the chat and the panes Teams' Recap has there: AI summary and Transcript. A part with only a transcript
//!   shows the files and the panes across the whole width. Teams' Copilot (its AI summary, speaker insights and their
//!   upsells) is left out: the AI summary is made on this computer instead ([`crate::recap_summary`]),
//!   when the user asks for one, laid out as Fathom's call summaries are, its moments played from a click, copied, or
//!   sent to the meeting's chat after a preview.
//! - **The transcript**: Teams' note that it is AI-generated, who started transcription, each speaker's turn (their
//!   initials, name and time into the recording) with its paragraphs; the paragraph being spoken is highlighted and
//!   kept in view while the recording plays, and a click on one plays the recording from there. Search finds the
//!   paragraphs that hold its words ("1/3", Enter or the arrows go on, the match highlighted); Download saves the
//!   `WebVTT` as Teams' "Download as .vtt" does. Its cues are also the recording's captions (the player's CC menu,
//!   named by the transcript's language as its item's transcripts give it), synced to where it plays.
//! - **Its states**: a spinner while the recap or a transcript is read; one that can't be read says so and offers to try
//!   again, or Teams on the web; a meeting that left nothing says so.
//!
//! The engine reads everything ([`Core::meeting_contents`], [`Core::meeting_transcript`],
//! [`Core::transcript_language`], [`Core::recording_file`], [`Core::file_stream`], the chat's stored messages for its
//! shared files); no view builds a request.
