//! A draft proofread before it is sent, on this computer, by the AI command-line tool the user picked
//! ([`crate::local_ai`]: Claude Code or the Codex CLI, the model [`Work::Correction`]): its spelling, grammar and style
//! in whatever language it is written, the recent messages of its chat as context so that their names and terms stay.
//!
//! - **Only when asked, and never sent**: the compose box starts one on the user's request and shows what comes back
//!   beside the draft as written ([`crate::compose`]'s correction); the draft stays as it was until the user takes it.
//! - **The draft keeps its shape** ([`draft`]): only the words of its text blocks go to the tool, between numbered
//!   markers; blocks of code, pictures, rules, mentions and inline code never do, and an answer that doesn't keep every
//!   marker is not used.
//! - **One run per request** ([`Correcting`]), on a thread of its own so the window never waits on the tool. Dropping it
//!   stops it and ends the tool's process.
//! - **Private**: no draft, message, correction or tool output is logged or traced.
