//! The calendar's dates and layout, apart from drawing ([`crate::calendar_view`] draws them): which days a view shows

//!
//! Every date is the viewer's own, in the local time zone; an event's start and end are placed there whatever form
//! the service gave them in ([`local`]). Weeks start on Monday, as the user's Teams shows them.
