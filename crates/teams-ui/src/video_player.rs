//! A video a message carries, played in its card as Teams plays one (`crate::files` draws the card's header): a black
//! box of the card's width holding the video's picture, with a seek bar and the controls over its bottom.
//!
//! - **Before it plays**: the file's thumbnail (Graph's, as the card shows it, `crate::inline::thumbnail`) with the
//!   controls over it. Play, a click on the picture or Space starts it: a [`Player`] (`teams-media`) on a thread of its
//!   own, streaming the file from the engine ([`Core::file_stream`](crate::bridge::Core::file_stream), through
//!   the card's [`PictureSource`]: no view builds a request), played by `GStreamer`, each frame shown here through
//!   GPUI's external surface, its sound on the speaker of the devices the app gave ([`set_playback`]).
//! - **The controls**, as Teams' player has them: play/pause, back 10 s, forward 10 s, mute (its volume slider beside
//!   it while the pointer is on it), the time (`0:10 / 1:52`), "More options" (open in the browser, download, copy link), full screen (the video over the whole
//!   window, the window full screen; Esc or the button leaves it) and "Open in browser" (Stream's player, where Teams
//!   pops the video out). The seek bar seeks
//!   where it is clicked or dragged to, its tooltip the time. While it plays the controls show only while the pointer
//!   is on the video; paused, always. Space plays or pauses, Left and Right go 10 s back or forward, M mutes.
//! - **Its states**: loading and buffering show a spinner over the picture; a video that can't be played here (a
//!   format no installed `GStreamer` plugin plays, a file the account can't read, the network) says so and offers the
//!   browser.
//! - The player lives as long as its card is drawn: a card scrolled away stops it. One plays at a time: starting one
//!   pauses the others, as in Teams.
//! - **In a meeting's recap** ([`crate::recap_view`]) the same player fills its column at 16:9 ([`VideoPlayer::filling`])
//!   and is told where to play from ([`VideoPlayer::play_from`]: a transcript's paragraph clicked), the recap reading its
//!   position to follow the transcript ([`VideoPlayer::position`]). It streams the recording as Teams' Recap player
//!   does ([`VideoPlayer::streaming`]): its DASH presentation and parts from the engine
//!   ([`Core::recording_presentation`](crate::bridge::Core::recording_presentation)), played by the same `GStreamer`
//!   player ([`Player::open_stream`]). That plays a recording whose download is blocked (an attendee's view of
//!   another's meeting), which the file's download link refuses; a recording that can't be streamed (not processed
//!   yet) is played from its download link, as any shared video, before the player says it can't be opened.
