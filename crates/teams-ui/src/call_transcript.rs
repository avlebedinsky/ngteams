//! Every call's live captions saved on this computer as its transcript (Settings > Calls > "Save live captions of every
//! call"): an ngteams feature of its own. Teams and the call's other people see nothing of it; only the captions'
//! own service is asked for, as the account's Show live captions asks for it.
//!
//! - **The recorder** ([`Recorder`], one per account, [`follow`]): while the setting is on, a call that connects
//!   (1:1, group or meeting; not the test call) gets its captions turned on ([`Ask::RecordCaptions`]: the caption
//!   feature's own start), their pane left as the user has it (hidden unless they show it). A start that failed is
//!   tried again a few times, apart. Each utterance's final result is kept in the store as it comes, with who said it
//!   and when (first heard, final): the transcript of the chat the call is in, the call's connect time its start
//!   ([`TranscriptWrite::Open`]). A call back in the same chat within [`REJOIN_WITHIN`] of the last one's end goes on
//!   in its transcript. The call's end is kept as the transcript's end. A later final result of an utterance replaces
//!   its words. The setting turned off mid-call stops the saving, and the captions when only the saving ran them. The
//!   read-only app saves nothing (turning the captions on is a request of its own).
//! - **What views show of it** ([`location`], [`part`], [`merged`], [`vtt`], [`attach`]): a transcript is a recap part
//!   of its own ([`teams_proto::recap::RecapPart`]) whose transcript is at `local:<account>:<id>`, its lines written as
//!   the `WebVTT` Teams' own transcripts are (speakers in `<v>` tags, times from the call's start), so the recap's
//!   transcript, search, download and AI summary take it as they take Teams'. Teams' own transcript of the same time
//!   wins: ours is offered only when Teams has none. A call's end row in its chat carries a link to it ([`attach`]).
//! - **Changes** are told on [`SavedTranscripts`] (an app global): views that show transcripts read them again.
//!
//! Nothing of the captions' words is logged or traced: the log says only that lines were kept, by how many.
