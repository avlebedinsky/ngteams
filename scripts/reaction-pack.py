"""Build the reaction pack the app draws reactions with: crates/teams-ui/assets/reactions/{catalog.tsv,emoji.bin}.

- The catalog is every reaction Teams offers, in its picker's categories and order: the web client's emoticon
  metadata (a public, unauthenticated read of Teams' CDN, `personal-expressions/v1/metadata/<version>/default.json`,
  the version the web bundle's config names as `emoticonAssetVersion`). Only the id (the reaction key Teams sends),
  the code points, whether it takes a skin tone, and the short description are kept, in a TSV of our own.
- The pictures are Microsoft's Fluent Emoji 3D (MIT, https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-emoji), the art Teams
  draws its reactions in, matched to the catalog by code points (variation selectors ignored), scaled to SIZE px and
  packed as WebP into one file; a catalog line names its picture's offset and length there. A reaction no Fluent
  picture matches draws its code points as text.

Usage: scripts/reaction-pack.py <fluentui-emoji checkout> [<metadata.json>]
       (a sparse checkout of `assets/*/metadata.json`, `assets/*/3D/*` and `assets/*/Default/3D/*` is enough; without
       a metadata file the script reads the CDN's for VERSION)
